# 👋 Hi, I'm Colin Maloney

CS senior at Florida State University (May 2026) with a focus on **Data Engineering** and **Backend Development**. I enjoy turning messy, unstructured data into something queryable and useful.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- **Data Engineer Intern @ ScratchOdds** — Building automated pipelines that scrape lottery statistics across 35+ US states, extracting 30+ data points per game on a twice-daily schedule, working with Python, Playwright, PostgreSQL, and Anthropic API for OCR-based text extraction.

- **Track Tracker** (in progress) — A data platform that detects emerging music tracks before they hit mainstream charts by monitoring Spotify and Soundcloud signals. Built with Airflow, AWS, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and Next.JS.
